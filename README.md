**Overview**

The Road Mapping System is a C++ project that models road networks as weighted graphs and computes the shortest paths between locations. The program reads a CSV file of intersections and road distances, builds a graph, and applies Dijkstra’s and Bellman-Ford algorithms to find optimal routes.

This project demonstrates graph theory, algorithm design, and file-based data processing.

**Key Features**

Graph Construction

Reads CSV input of intersections and distances

Builds a weighted, directed graph of the road network

Shortest Path Algorithms

Dijkstra’s Algorithm for non-negative edge weights

Bellman-Ford Algorithm for handling graphs with negative weights

Coordinate Integration

Maps user-provided coordinates to the nearest graph nodes

Finds shortest path between real-world points, not just predefined nodes

Output

Displays shortest path with ordered nodes

Reports total travel distance
